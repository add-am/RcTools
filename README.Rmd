# RcTools

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of RcTools is to provide a collection of tools (functions) to be utilised by the Northern Three Report Cards' technical staff. These tools bridge the gap between R analysis and technical report writing, and largely focus on producing xlsx files that are pre-formatted ready to be inserted into the technical report.

## Installation

To install this package you will first need to download the [RTools package](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools45/rtools.html) and install it on your computer (accept the defaults everywhere during the installation process).

Following this, you can install the development version of RcTools from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("add-am/RcTools")
```

## Usage

This package currently offers 1 key function, `save_n3_table()`, which is designed to format data frames into a specific style that is used in the Northern Three Report Cards. The function takes a data frame and formats it according to the specifications of the report card, including adding letter grades and adjusting the layout.

It has the following formatting options:

 - Report Card (with or without letter grades): This colours cell from red to green based on the standard Report Card boundaries.
 - Rainfall: This colours cells from brown to blue based on average rainfall codes (1 to 7).
 - Temperature: This colours cells from blue to red based on average temperature codes (1 to 7).
 - Summary Statistics: This compares mean/median values against WQOs and colours cells blue for pass and orange for fail.
 - Presence Abesnce: This colours cells based on presence (blue) and absence (grey), used for fish observation data.

Below is a basic example of how to use the `save_n3_table()` function to format a data frame for the Northern Three Report Card:

```{r example}
#| eval: false

#load the package
library(RcTools)

#create a basic dataset
df <- data.frame(
  "SubBasin" = c(
    "Black River", "Bluewater Creek", "Rollingstone Creek", "Crystal Creek", "Paluma",
    "Upper Ross River", "Lower Ross River", "Bohle River", "Stuart Creek", "Alligator Creek"
  ),
  "DIN" = c(seq(1, 100, 10)),
  "TP" = c(seq(100, 1, -10)),
  "Nutrients" = c(75, 49, 45, 54, 2, 91, 88, 41, 100, 80)
)

#run the "save as n3 table" function
save_n3_table(
  df = df, #select your data frame
  file_name = "output_file", #pick a name for your output file
  target_columns = 2:4, #specify which columns to format
  target_rows = 1:nrow(df), #specify which rows to format
  scheme = "Report Card", #define the formatting scheme
  include_letter = TRUE #decide if you want to include letter grades
  )

```

### Output

The output of the above function will be a .xlsx file with conditional formatting applied, which will look similar to the following:

Equally, rainfall data looks like this:

temperature data looks like this:

summary statistics data looks like this:

and presence absence data looks like this:
