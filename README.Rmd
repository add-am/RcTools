# RcTools

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of RcTools is to provide a collection of tools (functions) to be utilised by the Northern Three Report Cards' technical staff. These tools bridge the gap between R analysis and technical report writing, and largely focus on producing xlsx files that are pre-formatted ready to be inserted into the technical report.

## Installation

You can install the development version of RcTools from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("add-am/RcTools")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#| echo: false
#| output: false

library(RcTools)

#create a basic dataset
df <- data.frame(
  "Region" = c(rep("Dry Tropics", 10)),
  "Basin" = c(rep(c("Black", "Ross"), each = 5)),
  "SubBasin" = c(
    "Black River", "Bluewater Creek", "Rollingstone Creek", "Crystal Creek", "Paluma",
    "Upper Ross River", "Lower Ross River", "Bohle River", "Stuart Creek", "Alligator Creek"
  ),
  "DIN" = c(seq(1, 100, 10)),
  "TP" = c(seq(100, 1, -10)),
  "Nutrients" = c(75, 49, 45, 54, 2, 91, 88, 41, 100, 80)
)

#run the "save as n3 table" function
save_n3_table(
  df = df,
  file_name = "output_file",
  target_columns = 4:6,
  target_rows = 3:8,
  scheme = "Report Card",
  include_letter = TRUE
  )

```

The before and after of the above function is as follows:
